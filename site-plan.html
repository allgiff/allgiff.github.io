        I chose this font because it is a simple sans serif, wich works well with serif fonts.  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Time Savers</h3>
      <p>      Overview<br />
Meal planning and shopping can be very stressful for college students, especially when you are just starting out. It can be difficult to track and budget your money, making sure you have enough to cover your immediate needs such as food and rent, as well as money for fun activities like date night or seeing a movie. Going to a busy store, crowded with tons of people rushing around to find things they need is stressful and overwhelming. That is why it is very important to go in with a plan.
 
<br />Subparagraph 1- Budgeting<br />
I have found several different ways to budget and have experimented with them as I go through life. Sometimes you can find a style that works great for you, and others you have to mix and match. I have noticed that as I grow and change my budgeting method changed too. The one I am currently using is known as the “Zero Based Budget.” I discovered this method in a book called “The Graduate Survival Guide” by Anthony Oneal and Rachel Cruze. The budget is simple and allows you to plan out what you are spending ahead of time, so you don’t need to stress about it later. You’re giving each dollar of your income a ‘job,’ that way when it is all written out your expenses subtracted from your income equals zero. It is a really simple and great method that really helps me handle my money.
[also talk about the Jordan Paige envelope method.] <br />

<br />Subparagraph 2- Shopping<br />
Shopping can be difficult when it seems like the store is constantly teeming with people rushing around. I have gone shopping several times and discovered that the store was completely out of an ingredient I needed, such as milk. It is both stressful and overwhelming. That is why it is important to have a plan when you enter the store, and get things done fast. One thing that really helps me with this is meal planning. It is also really important to go into the store with a list. I use a free shopping list app called OurGroceries. I like it because it puts foods together by where they are in the store. For example all the fresh fruit and vegetables you need will be in the produce category while other things such as flour and cake mix will be in the baking category. This way when you shop it will be easier to find everything quickly because you aren’t running back and forth to the same isles. It has really helped me out.<br />

<br />Subparagraph 3- Meal Prep<br />
Planning out what meals you are going to be making that month can relieve stress and give you one less thing to worry about. However, it is important to do it right. Oftentimes people will do this method backwards, looking at all the recipes they want to make before they think about what is already in your fridge. It is important to see what ingredients you already have and see what meals you can make with those ingredients. It can save you a lot of money. A good tool for this method is allrecipes.com because they have a search by ingredient option. After you figure out all of your meals you can add the ingredients you don’t already have to your shopping list, minimizing how much food you need to buy. One of my favorite things about meal planning is that you can add meal prep into this system. I do this by choosing meals that can be frozen for later or will keep in the fridge so you can use them for dinners a few days later, which takes the time you would be using to make meals every night for other things, like studying or hanging out with friends.
