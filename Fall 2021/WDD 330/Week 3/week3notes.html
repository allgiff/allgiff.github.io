    <ul>
        <li>Objects: Represent entities in the real world (users, orders, etc.)</li>
        <li>User actions (login, shopping cart) are represented by functions in properties in JavaScript</li>
        <li>Method: Functions that are stored in object properties</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Methods are simplified, a form of shorthand for functions</li>
        </ol>
        <li>this.: refers to the 'owner' of the method</li>
        <ol>
        <li>Arrow functions don't have a this. When used in the arrow funnction it is taken from outside</li>
        <li>Value changes depending on how a function is called</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Object: self-contained set of related values and functions</li>
        <li>If a property’s value is a function, it is known as amethod</li>
        <li>Object Literal: object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces</li>
        <ol>
            <li>can be passed as a parameter to a function</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Properties of an object can be accessed using the dot notation</li>
        <li>Can also be accessed using bracket notation. Only way to access nonstandard property and method names</li>
        <li>Computed Properties: code can be placed inside square brackets and the property key will be the return value of that code</li>
        <li>Call a method using dot or bracket notation. Same as invoking a function (needs parentheses)</li>
        <li>in: Can be used to check wether an object has a certain property</li>
        <li>hasOwnProperty(): Can be used to check whether an object has a property that is its own, rather than one that has been inherited from another object</li>
        <li>for in: loop through all of an object’s properties and methods</li>
        <li>Object.keys(): Will return an array of all the keys of any object that is provided as an argument</li>
        <li>bject.entries(): Returns an array of key-value pairs</li>
        <li>Adding Properties: Assigning a value to the new property</li>
        <li>Nested Objects: Object that contains other objects</li>
        <li>This: Refers to the object that it is in</li>
        <li>object literal pattern: Creates a namespace for groups of related functions</li>
        <li>JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange information</li>
        <li>Javascript has many built in math methods</li>
        <li>Date object: Contains information about dates and times</li>
        <li>Getter Method: return information about the date object</li>
        <li>Setter Method: used to change the value of the date held in a Date object</li>
        <li>The Regex object can be used to create regular expressions.</li>
    </ul>
