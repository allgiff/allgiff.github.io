    <ul>
        <li>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>System error: thereâ€™s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting</li>
            <li>Programmer error: the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo</li>
            <li>User error: the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Exceptions: an error that produces a return value that is used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Also produces a stack trace: sequence of functions or method calls that lead to where the wrror occured</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Warning: ocurrs when there is a code error that does not result in a crash</li>
        <li>Consoles are used to debugg and log information</li>
        <li>Error object: can be created using the host environment when an exception occurs. Can also be created in code using constructor function</li>
        <li>throwing exceptions: possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement</li>
        <li>You can use try, catch and finally to test if the function will result in an exception, and deal with it</li>
        <li>Test-driven Development: the process of writing tests before any code</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the following pattern: 1) Write tests (that initially fail) 2) Write code to pass the tests 3) Refactor the code 4) Test refactored code 5) Write more tests for new features</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
