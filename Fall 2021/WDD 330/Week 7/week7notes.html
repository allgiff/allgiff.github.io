    <p>...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Functions are: First-Class Objects: can be passed around in the same way as every other value.</li>
        <li>Call Method: Used to set the value of thos inside a function to an object provided as the first argument</li>
        <li>Description Property: Can be used to describe what a function does</li>
        <li>Memoization: The result of a function can be stored in the cache so that it does not have to loop through many times</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression: An anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s defined.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Temp: Temporary variable that only exists while an IIFE is invoked</li>
            <li>Initialization Code: A form of IIFE that initalizes code</li>
            <li>IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program (can be added or removed seperatly)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Self-defining functions: Done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function</li>
        <li>Init-time branching: enables the functions to work more effectively in the browser, and avoid checking for features every time they’re invoked</li>
        <li>Recursive function: invokes itself until a certain condition is met</li>
        <li>Promise: represents the future result of an asynchronous operation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When a promise is created it is pending. Once an opperation is completed it is settled & can result in 2 different outcomes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully</li>
                <li>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Creating a promise: Created using a constructor function</li>
            <ul>
                <li>takes an executor as an argument, which initalizes and starts the opperation</li>
                <li>Accepts two functions as arguments:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>resolve(): called if opperation is successful</li>
                    <li>reject(): called if opperation fails</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Closures: Powerful javascript feature</li>
        <li>Generator: special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value</li>
        <li>Pure Functions: return value only depends on given arguments, no side effects, will always return the same result when the same arguments are given</li>
        <li>Higher-order functions: accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both</li>
        <li>Currying: process that involves the partial application of functions</li>
        <li>Ajax: technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server. (updates pages without reloading, like a live server)</li>
        <li>fetch(): returns a promise that resolves to the reponse returned from the URL</li>
        <li>response interface: deals with the object returned when the promise is fulfilled</li>
        <li>redirect(): used to redirect to another URL, and creates a new promise</li>
        <li>text(): reads text from a response and returns a promise that can be treated as a string</li>
        <li>blob(): used to read raw data and returns a promise that resolves with a blob object</li>
        <li>Request objects: created using the request constructor, and gives control over the request</li>
        <li>headers: used to pass additional information about a request or response</li>
        <li>Ajax can also be used to send information, usually as a JSON string</li>
        <li>Ajax is still subject to change because it is a 'living standard'</li>
    </ul>
