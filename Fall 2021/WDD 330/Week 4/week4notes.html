    <p>...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Forms: allow users to enter certain information into a web page or app</li>
        <ul>
        <li>You can use the mane to identify a form</li>
        <li>Elements: method that returns an HTML collection of the elements contained in the form</li>
        <li>form controls can also be accessed using name attributes</li>
        <li>form.submit()method: submit the form automatically</li>
        <li>form.reset()method: reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML</li>
        <li>form.action property: can be used to set theactionattribute of a form, so itâ€™s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server</li>
        <li>focus event: occurs when an element is focused on</li>
        <li>blur event: occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element</li>
        <li>change event: occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it</li>
        <li>value property: can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.</li>
        <li>Input Type: Used to label and adjust form boxes for the type of input. (ex type="password" makes the password secret/invisible)</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Check boxes: allow the user to select multipul options</li>
        <li>Radio Button: similar to check boxes, but only allow the user to select one item</li>
        <li>Hidden: input fields can be hidden. Used for settings or already added info</li>
        <li>file: Used to upload files</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Dtop down list: used to select one or more options from a list of values</li>
        <li>Text area: used to enter long pieces of text (ie comment or blog post)</li>
        <li>Required: requires the user to enter something in the required field before the form will submit</li>
        <li>Validation: ensures all items have been completed (ie password is at least 8 characters, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Object Oriented programming: Used to model representations of objects in real world</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation: Inner workings are hidden inside the object, with only essenntial functions shown</li>
            <li>Ploymorphism: The same process being used by different objects. Objects can share the same method</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Different objects can have the same method, but use it in different ways</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Inheritance: taking the features of one object, and adding new features</li>
            <li>Constructor Function: defines the properties and methods of an object</li>
            <li>Classes: can be declared in JavaScript, does the same thing as a constructor function, but is more similar to other programming languages.</li>
            <li>Constructor Property: returns the constructor function that created it</li>
            <li>Static Methods: called by the class directly rather than by class instances</li>
            <li>Prototypal Inheritance: every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be used to add extra properties and methods to the class after it has been created.</li>
                <li>Prototypes should be used for adding new properties and methods after the class has been declared</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Enumerable Properties:  If I property is not enumerable it will not show up when a for-in loop is used</li>
            <li>Extends: Causes a class to inherit from another class</li>
            <li>Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(): gets and defines property descriptors</li>
            <li>It is possible to create objects using other objects as a blueprint. Can be done using Object Create</li>
            <li>Mixins: Used to add properties to an object, often a large amount all at once</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Can also be used to create a copy function, which creates an exact copy of an object</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Modular JavaScript</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Module: self contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can be used by other modules</li>
            <li>Keeps code organized in seperate reuseable files, and makes it easier to maintain code</li>
            <li>Coupling: Elements or modules that are dependant on each other</li>
            <li>export: keyword that takes a module and applies part of it to the code you are working with</li>
            <li>Default export: a single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named (Do Not use more than once)</li>
            <li>Alias: assigned alias in imported module does not have to match the name in the original module</li>
            <li>Node modules use a slightly different notation than ES6</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
