    <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>
    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>Practiced APIs in star wars team activity</p>
    <p>Did Modern Workflow Activity</p>
    <p>Did Code Academy Exercises</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Global Object: Any variables created in global scope are properties of this object</li>
        <li>Browser Object Model (BOM): collection of properties and methods that contain information the browser and computer screen</li>
        <li>Dialogs</li>
        <ul>
        <li>window.alert(): pauses program execution and displays message in dialog box</li>
        <li>window.confirm(): top the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. </li>
        <li>Window.prompt(): top the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Window.location:  contains information about the URL of the current page</li>
        <li>Window.open(): opens a new window. First parameter is URL, window title is second, and attribute list is third. There is also a close method</li>
        <li>Cookies: small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set them</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cookies can be created using document.cookie. Adding secure onto it will make sure it is only transmitted over a secure network</li>
            </ul>
        <li>setTimeout():  accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter</li>
        <li>setInterval(): will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be used to animate elements on a web page</li>
        </ul>
        <li>APIs: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Data attribute: way of embedding data in a web page using attributes ignored by the browser</li>
            <li>Web storage API does not share information with server on every request</li>
            <li>Geolocation API: used to obtain the geographical position of the device</li>
            <li>Web Workers: allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Service Worker: allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests</li>
            <li>Web Socket: protocol that allows two-way communication with a server</li>
            <li>Notifications: allows you to show messages using the system's notifications</li>
            <li>Multimedia: audio and video tags that are used to insert audio and video clips into an html page</li>
            <li>Shums and Polyfils: These are libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual. They then fill in the necessary code that's not provided natively by the user’s browser</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
