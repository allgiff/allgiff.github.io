    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>I need to figure out a way for the note title on the side to update when the user types in the note, but I can't find anything on Google. Any advice?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Client side validation: ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format</li>
        <li>form validation: When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application</li>
        <li>You can use the built in validation, or create it yourself using javascript</li>
        <li>Build in</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The element needs to match the :valid or :invalid psudeo classes</li>
            <li>To mark an item as required use :required</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Regular expression: pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings</li>
        <li>Validating with Javascript:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Constraint validation API: consists of a set of methods and properties available on the following form element DOM interfaces</li>
            <li>You can also implement a custom error message</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fetch: provides an easy way to fetch resources across the network. Useful for working with APIs</li>
        <li>When you fetch it retuns a promise that is resolved using the response object</li>
        <li>Fetch can accept a second parameter</li>
        <li>If the fetch is rejected it will respond with a TypeError</li>
        <li>You can also supply your own request using the Request() constructor, and pass it in as a fetch argument</li>
        <li>Headers(): Constructor that allows you to create your own headers object</li>
        <li>Guard: affects which mutation operations are allowed on the headers object</li>
        <li>Polyfill: recreate the functionality for non-supporting browsers</li>
    </ul>
