            Meal planning and shopping can be very stressful for college
            students, especially when you are just starting out. It can be
            difficult to track and budget your money, making sure you have
            enough to cover your immediate needs such as food and rent, as well
            as money for fun activities like date night or seeing a movie. Going
            to a busy store, crowded with tons of people rushing around to find
            things they need is stressful and overwhelming. That is why it is
            very important to go in with a plan.

            Planning out what meals you are going to be making that month can
            relieve stress and give you one less thing to worry about. However,
            it is important to do it right. Oftentimes people will do this
            method backwards, looking at all the recipes they want to make
            before they think about what is already in your fridge. It is
            important to see what ingredients you already have and see what
            meals you can make with those ingredients. It can save you a lot of
            money. A good tool for this method is allrecipes.com because they
            have a search by ingredient option. <br /><br />
            After you figure out all of your meals you can add the ingredients
            you don’t already have to your shopping list, minimizing how much
            food you need to buy. One of my favorite things about meal planning
            is that you can add meal prep into this system. I do this by
            choosing meals that can be frozen for later or will keep in the
            fridge so you can use them for dinners a few days later, which takes
            the time you would be using to make meals every night for other
            things, like studying or hanging out with friends.

            Shopping

          <p class="t-content-2">
            Shopping can be difficult when it seems like the store is constantly
            teeming with people rushing around. I have gone shopping several
            times and discovered that the store was completely out of an
            ingredient I needed, such as milk. It is both stressful and
            overwhelming. That is why it is important to have a plan when you
            enter the store, and get things done fast. <br /><br />One thing
            that really helps me with this is meal planning. It is also really
            important to go into the store with a list. I use a free shopping
            list app called OurGroceries. I like it because it puts foods
            together by where they are in the store. For example all the fresh
            fruit and vegetables you need will be in the produce category while
            other things such as flour and cake mix will be in the baking
            category. This way when you shop it will be easier to find
            everything quickly because you aren’t running back and forth to the
            same isles. It has really helped me out.

            Budgeting

          <p class="t-content-3">
            I have found several different ways to budget and have experimented
            with them as I go through life. Sometimes you can find a style that
            works great for you, and others you have to mix and match. I have
            noticed that as I have gotten older my budgeting method has changed
            to suit my needs. <br /><br />The method I am currently using is
            known as the “Zero Based Budget.” The template for this method is
            shown on the left of the page. I discovered this method in a book
            called “The Graduate Survival Guide” by Anthony Oneal and Rachel
            Cruze. The budget is simple and allows you to plan out what you are
            spending ahead of time, so you don’t need to stress about it later.
            You’re giving each dollar of your income a ‘job,’ that way when it
            is all written out your expenses subtracted from your income equals
            zero. It is a really simple and great method that really helps me
            handle my money.<br /><br />
            I use a different method when it comes to 'fun money.' I always make
            sure to put that category into my budget, but I withdraw that
            alloted money in cash so that I don't end up overspending. It helps
            me to visually see how much I have, and how much I use.
